# Salary Prediction using the Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2025

## Project Overview
This project is the final assignment for the Big Data Analytics course. 
The objective is to predict developers’ salaries using data from the Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2025, applying data preparation and machine learning techniques within the KNIME Analytics Platform.

## Research Objective
The main goal of the analysis is to identify the key technical, demographic, and professional factors that influence developers’ compensation and to assess the predictive performance of different machine learning models.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2025.
Due to GitHub file size limitations, the raw dataset is not included in this repository.

The dataset can be downloaded from the official Stack Overflow website:
https://survey.stackoverflow.co/

The file containing the survey questions and variable descriptions is available in the `data/` folder.

## Methodology
The analysis follows a structured data science pipeline:
- Data understanding and cleaning
- Feature selection and encoding
- Train/test split
- Comparison of multiple machine learning models

All preprocessing and modeling steps are implemented and documented in KNIME workflows.

## Tools
- KNIME Analytics Platform
- Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2025
